# One-Line Raytracer

**Experimental code. I had a weekend to waste.**

A fully functional raytracer written in a single line of C++17 code. Renders a sphere, a checkered floor, lighting, and shadows.

## Compile & Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 oneLineTracer.cpp -o oneLineTracer
./oneLineTracer
```

Outputs an `output.ppm` file.

## Features

- Single line of code (excluding includes and main declaration)
- 3D scene with sphere, floor, lighting, and shadows
- Uses C++17 features (lambdas, structured bindings, tuples)
- Experimental code, not meant for production

## Why?

Because I could.
